# Feed-forward-neural-networks

Build a multi-layer neural network to solve the XOR classification
problem. Use the provided FFNN as a starting point. Test against the data
generated by gen_xor() from gen_data.py. Show:
a) the testing percent correct;
b) the training progress curves; and
c) the decision surface with overload training data.

Implement a feed-forward neural network function from scratch,
using only built-in Python modules and numpy. Extract the learned
weights from Q1 and run the model through your custom implementation.
